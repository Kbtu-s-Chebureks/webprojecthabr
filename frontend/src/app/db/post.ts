        text: "Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. Practice respiratory hygiene Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.",

        title: "Most Popular Computer Problems We Are Facing Everyday",
        text: "In today’s contemporary world the private computer has become a staple of daily life. Even those few persons who don't use computers in their daily work life can possibly have access to a computer on that they perform alternative necessary tasks. With all of the access to info that computers permit and with all of the work they will facilitate a personal perform, this trend of a computer in every home and in each workplace of business isn't shocking. But what may be shocking, and downright aggravating, is when the computer you are working on suddenly shuts off, goes blank, or explodes in the dreaded blue screen of death. These and other common computer problems are among the most frequently occurring issues that one might experience with their computers. The following may be a list of 5 common Computer issues and what may be done to mend them. The Computer Shuts Off or Won’t Start. This is maybe the foremost common Computer drawback and will be the best fix. Often, this is often a symptom that the ability supply to the pc is out of whack or out of service and fast check of the ability offer might fix this drawback. If not, professional aid may be required. Malfunctioning Operating System The most common reason behind an out of whack software Software is that the presence of an outbreak or alternative malicious adware that the pc has picked up. Restarting the computer and running a virus scan may be the best help. Consider conjointly putting in a reliable program if the matter persists. Frozen Screen Screen freezes area unit typically a result of inadequate memory on the pc, malfunctioning files, or spyware that is attacking the system. Professional medicine and dealing to wash up the system yourself ought to limit the frequency of frozen screens. Slow Computer Often computers can begin to run slower as addition files and programs area unit created and keep thereon. Clean out unwanted files can facilitate regain some lost speed. Slow Internet Like the Computer itself, the Internet connection between the server and the computer can get jammed full of your cookies and temporary files that have been stored as a result of your Internet use. Clearing these will increase Internet browsing speed. These and alternative computer issues plague the trendy world and frustrate virtually everybody a minimum of once in life. Most, however, may be mounted either by you the user or by a computer professional of the website.",

        title: "How iOS Developers Are Seeking To Up The Ante With Cloud Computing",
        text: "As a platform, many enterprises are leveraging iOS to realize the amazing benefits of cloud computing. This is one aspect of digital transformation that has been rocking the entire industry in recent times. Generally, there is only a few internet-based development and deployment service performed on the platform that is not concerned with cloud application development. Nowadays, there is a growing population of iOS developers and app development companies that are steadily adopting cloud computing. Why Consider Cloud Computing? Today many emerging app developers and top app development companies prefer cloud computing simply because it employs scalable web-based infrastructure that comes very handy with a unique cloud capacity and functionality. To most organizations, this is generally the way to go particularly when it comes to performing tasks with fast development processes. Just as how users are switching from desktop to mobile internet that is how today’s app developers are moving to the cloud to enhance effective access of valuable data even while on the move from any location at any time. There are several reasons why app programmers and development companies involved with iPhone app development think it very needful to move their databases to the cloud. However, cost-effectiveness and app optimization still remains the most essential reasons. As a dynamic means of enabling teams remotely collaborating on projects to achieve quick and effective business goals, investors have already begun leveraging on this technology to improve app development processes across a wide range of industries. These days, many top app development companies are getting more and more involved in investing in cloud app development simply because applications developed on the cloud technology are not only yielding better results but also providing a better return on investment (ROI) for investors. App development companies that decide to go to the cloud need to develop a new set of tools and best practices to maintain the trend. Generally, there are certain things that should be taken into consideration before even attempting to develop iOS apps for the cloud. Understanding Cloud Computing in iOS Development When it comes to cloud app development, not everybody understands what it means to adopt cloud computing. Navigating the world of cloud technologies via iPhone app development opens up doors for better opportunities. For easy elastic (scalable) cloud computing, it has become even more interesting, these days, to see how developers from around the globe are getting on the iOS platform to engage in efficient cloud app development processes. Scalability or elasticity has been a major issue in the industry since the introduction of iPhone app development, as a whole. While many enterprises and individual business owners have begun adopting app development as an efficient and effective means of enhancing business growth in the modern tech world, the problem of making the tech grow with these businesses soon rose to become a huge challenge. But thanks to the introduction and adoption of the cloud-based app technology, things have already begun taking a different shape. While there are several web services that offer scaling capacities for the technology, most developers and app development companies in the industry are more interested in services that can enable them to create numerous server instances within the shortest possible time. Many of these custom application development companies are becoming more and more involved with the development of cloud-based apps that grow along with their clients' businesses. Amazon has been a big player in this industry through various web services that are aimed at improving cloud technology by supporting small, medium and top app development companies with the right services they need to effectively integrate cloud technology into their app development projects. Generally, it is all about providing easy access to data stored on scalable cloud storage or computing system. No doubt, the internet is great but the cloud is greater. Interestingly, iOS is highly supportive of the wishes and demands of developers seeking fast web-scale cloud app development by providing the enabling environment and resources required for them to grow. When it comes to iPhone app development, there is simply no better way for developers to enjoy a more reliable and easy data storage capacity than this. Benefits of Adopting A Cloud-Based iOS Development Approach One of the major benefits iOS developers enjoy by adopting a cloud-based development approach is the improved security threat detection capabilities that come with moving mobile apps to the cloud. Basically, there is a need for certain app agents to be deployed to inspect file activity on the mobile cloud and send them for further analysis. Multiple virtualized detection engines can be used to analyze activity files to determine the presence of malware or an intruder that may be attempting to compromise the app. This is mainly aimed at helping developers and other development agencies to identify malicious or unwanted content through the cloud service. As the scale and sophistication of mobile threats continue to be on the increase, many top app development companies and even mobile app developers are beginning to focus more attention and efforts on the various ways of adopting more valuable cloud-based approaches to protect their apps from getting ruined or attacked. To this end, many top app development companies are not resting on their laurels but rather, choose to up the ante by integrating valuable cloud services into their app development processes which invariably exposes them to reduced mobile device resources consumption, less complex mobile software, and increased virus detection coverage.",

        title: "Using Data Science for house hunting in Montreal",
        text: "Introduction I happen to live in Montreal, in my condo on the edge of McGill Ghetto. Close to Saint Laurent Boulevard or the Maine as locals call it, with all it's attractions — bars, restaurants, night clubs, drunken students. And once upon a time, on a particular lively night, listening to the sounds of McGill frosh students drunkenly heading home after hard night of studying. I thought, that it might be a good idea to move into my own house, a little bit further away from the action.It was not my first rodeo, buying a real estate in Montreal, but first time buying a house. So, I decided to do a little bit of research, before trusting my money to a real estate agent. I quickly realized that I can't afford a house anywhere close to the subway station on the Island, but I could possible afford a duplex or a triplex, where tenants would be covering part of my mortgage. The solution to this problem depends not only on the price of the house, but also on the rent or potential rent that the tenants could be paying. So, being a visual person with background in research, I wanted to see a visual map of how much things cost around the island, and how much revenue I could get. In the States, and even in Ontario there are services like Zillow that can show some of the information, but for Montreal I couldn't find anything, apart from the realtor association APCIQ. Maybe my preference of using English language is to blame. So, after a few weeks of studying realtor.ca and kijiji, I wrote a python script to scrape information from them, using some resources I found on github: https://github.com/Froren/realtorca. Also, city of Montreal have an open data web site, that helps to fill-out some blanks. After the data is collected by webscrappers it is processed in R, using tidy-verse, Simple Features for R. I found excellent resources on how to process geospatial information in R: Geocomputation with R, I used ggplot2 to make graphs and thematic maps for map making. Now I have more then a year worth of data to study.",

        title: "How linear algebra is applied in machine learning",
        text: "You see that linear algebra helps you to apply and to train your models. But the real science (or magic) starts when your model refuses to train or predict well. The learning may get stuck at a bad point, or suddenly go wild. In deep learning, it often happens due to vanishing or exploding gradients. That is, whey you calculate the gradient, you multiply lots of matrices, and then strange things happen, and you need to know what, why, and how to overcome it. One of the ways to inspect what is happening is to keep track of the eigenvalues of the matrices you are trying to invert. If they are close to 0, or just very different, then the inversion of this matrix can lead to unstable results. If you multiply many matrices with large eigenvalues, the product explodes. When these eigenvalues are small, the result fades to zero. Different techniques, like L1/L2 regularization, batch normalization, and LSTM were invented in order to fight these problems with convergence. If you want to apply any of those techniques, you need a way to measure whether they help much for your particular problem. And if you want to invent such a technique yourself, you need a way to prove that it can work at all. This again involves lots of manipulation with vectors, matrices, their decompositions, etc.",

        title: "Fractal Indicator Definition",
        text: "What is a Fractal? The fractal indicator is based on a simple price pattern that is frequently seen in financial markets. Outside of trading, a fractal is a recurring geometric pattern that is repeated on all time frames. From this concept, the fractal indicator was devised. The indicator isolates potential turning points on a price chart. It then draws arrows to indicate the existence of a pattern. The bullish fractal pattern signals the price could move higher. A bearish fractal signals the price could move lower. Bullish fractals are marked by a down arrow, and bearish fractals are marked by an up arrow. KEY TAKEAWAYS A bullish fractal occurs when there is a low point with two higher low bars/candles on each side of it. A bearish fractal occurs when there is a high point with two lower high bars/candles on each side of it. An up arrow marks the location of a bearish fractal, while a down arrow marks the location of a bullish fractal. Arrows are drawn above or below the middle bar (high or low point), even though the pattern is five bars. There is no way a trader could enter a trade at the arrow because the arrow only occurs if the next two bars create the pattern. If someone were to trade fractal signals, the entry would be the open price of the third bar after the arrow.How to Calculate the Fractal Indicator Calculating fractals has more to do with visual acuity than math. Isolate a high/low (N) point on the chart. If there are two lower highs to the left of the high or two higher lows to the left of the low (N-2 and N-1), there is a possible pattern. The pattern still needs two more bars on the right to confirm. If two lower highs occur after the high then a bearish fractal is complete (N+1 and N+2). If two higher lows occur after the low a bullish fractal is complete. What the Fractal Indicator Tells You The fractal indicator will generate signals frequently. The existence of a fractal isn't necessarily important since the pattern is so common. The fractal is indicating the possibility of a trend change. This is because fractals are essentially showing a U-shape in price. A bearish fractal has the price moving upward and then downward, forming an upsidedown U. A bullish fractal occurs when the price is moving down but then starts to move up, forming a U. Because fractals occur so frequently, and many of the signals aren't reliable entry points, fractals are typically filtered using some other form of technical analysis. Bill Williams also invented the alligator indicator which isolates trends. By combining fractals with trend analysis, a trader may decide to only trade bullish fractals signals while the price trend is up. If the trend is down they may take only short trades on bearish fractal signals, for example. Fractals could also be used with other indicators, such as pivot points or Fibonacci retracement levels. A fractal is only acted on if it aligns with one of these other indicators and potentially the longer-term price direction. For example, assume a stock is trending higher. The price is pulling back and reaches a 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Since the trend is up, and the price is near a Fibonacci retracement level, the trader will take a trade if a bullish fractal forms. The Difference Between the Fractal Indicator and Chart Patterns The fractal indicator is unique in that it identifies a price pattern and marks it on the chart. Fractals are specific five-bar patterns. Chart patterns can also be drawn on the chart, although they are not limited to five price bars. Chart patterns also include many different shapes, such as triangles, rectangles, and wedges to list a few. While some software will mark chart patterns on a chart, most chartists find and isolate chart patterns by hand. Limitations of Using the Fractal Indicator The main problem with fractals is that there are so many of them. They occur frequently and trying to trade all of them will rapidly deplete a trading account due to losing trades. These are called false signals or whipsaws. Therefore, filter the signals with some other indicator or form of analysis. The arrows for the indicator are typically drawn over the high or low or point, which is the middle of the fractal, not where the fractal completes. Therefore, the arrows can be visually deceiving. Since the pattern is actually completing two bars to the right of the arrow, the first available entry point after seeing an arrow is the opening price of the third bar to the right of the arrow.",

        title: "Python or R: Which Is A Better Choice For Data Science?",
        text: "Data science is going to revolutionize this world completely in the coming years. The tough question among data scientists is that which programming language plays the most important role in data science? There are many programming languages used in data science including R, C++, Python. In this blog, we are going to discuss two important programming languages namely Python and R. This will help you choose the best-fit language for your next data science project. Python is an open-source, flexible, object-oriented and easy-to-use programming language. It has a large community base and consists of a rich set of libraries & tools. It is, in fact, the first choice of every data scientist. On the other hand, R is a very useful programming language for statistical computation & data science. It offers unique technique's viz. nonlinear/linear modeling, clustering, time-series analysis, classical statistical tests, and classification technique. Features of Python Dynamically typed language, so the variables are defined automatically. More readable and uses less code to perform the same task as compared to other programming languages. Strongly typed. So, developers have to cast types manually. An interpreted language. This means that the program need not be compiled. Flexible, portable and can run on any platform easily. It is scalable and can be integrated with other third-party software easily. R features for data science apps Multiple calculations can be done with vectors Statistical language You can run your code without any compiler Data science support Here, I have listed out some domains that are used to differentiate these two programming languages for data science. 1) Data structures When it comes to data structures, binary trees can be easily implemented in Python but this process is done in R by using list class which is a slow move. Implementation of binary trees in Python is shown below: First, create a node class and assign any value to the node. This will create a tree with a root node.",
